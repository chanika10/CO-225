should the average percentage attendance be 50%? Explain.

yes.Here we obtain the random value for the attendance.
But those random values are distributed uniformly(uniform distribution).
In an uniform distribution,the mean value will always be 50.
But in this case we use average values and round off values.
Therefore the answer obtain by the code will be a nearest value to 50%.
